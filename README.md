# Use case assignments for AWS.

## Use Case : 1
Tasks involved in this part are as follows:

a). Writing a cloudformation template to create a stack with an AWS S3 Bucket resource.

b). Writing a simple lambda function that is executed whenever a file is uploaded into the above created bucket and prints the name of the bucket that invoked the lambda.

c). Using pytest with Jenkins to get hands on experience of automated build and testing. Deployed locally an instance of Jenkins for this purpose.
